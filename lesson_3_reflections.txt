Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
A: When working on a project with other programmers who don't have access to your local machine
and are remote or are working on the same project from their individual machines.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because in cases the project is collaborative: if GitHub were to automatically update my local repository it could potentially get
really messy and I would loose track of what my own work.
