Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
A: When working on a project with other programmers who don't have access to your local machine
and are remote or are working on the same project from their individual machines.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Because in cases the project is collaborative: if GitHub were to automatically update my local repository it could potentially get
really messy and I would loose track of what my own work.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are clones of remotes on GitHub. Forking means cloning a repository from another GitHub user. 
Clones can either be on within GitHub (forks), from GitHub to a local machine through GitBash, from
a local machine to GitHub via the push method, or they can happen locally. Branches are versions of the 
same code that have been grouped under a given name.
